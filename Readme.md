# Pull Request Comment Trigger

Look for a "trigger word" in a pull-request description or comment, so that later actions can know whether or not to run.

<!-- TODO release workflow-preprocessor This is most useful in tandem with [workflow-preprocessor], so that you don't have to be writing a ton of `if`s all down the line. -->

## Example usage in a workflow

Your workflow needs to listen to the following events:
```
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
```

And then you can use the action in your jobs like this:

```
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: khan/pull-request-comment-trigger@master
        id: check
        with:
          trigger: '@deploy'
          reaction: rocket
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
      - run: 'echo Found it!'
        if: steps.check.outputs.triggered == 'true'
```

Reaction must be one of the reactions here: https://developer.github.com/v3/reactions/#reaction-types
And if you specify a reaction, you have to provide the `GITHUB_TOKEN` env vbl.
